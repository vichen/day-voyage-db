This repo is intended for use as an API to power [Day Voyage](https://github.com/sweaty-figs/day-voyage).

1. [GettingStarted](#gettingstarted)
2. [Requirements](#requirements)
3. [Endpoints] (#endpoints)
4. [Schemas] (#schemas)

## GettingStarted
- [ ] Install [Nodal](https://github.com/keithwhor/nodal) globally

- [ ] Start server

```sh
npm install -g nodal
npm install
nodal s
```
Your app should now be running on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

##Development##
Mock data is included with the repo. To seed database:
```sh
nodal db:prepare
nodal db:migrate
nodal db:seed
```

## Requirements
